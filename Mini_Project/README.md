## Title : “Innovative Clap Switch: Integrating IR Detection With Arduino”  
 In modern environments, the need for intuitive and efficient control systems for lighting and 
appliances has become increasingly significant. Traditional switches often require manual 
interaction, which can be inconvenient, especially in situations where hands are full or for 
individuals with mobility challenges. Additionally, the constant need for physical interaction 
with switches can lead to energy waste when lights are left on unnecessarily. 
This project aims to address these issues by developing a smart lighting system that utilizes 
both a clap sensor and an infrared (IR) sensor 
By integrating sound and motion detection, this project seeks to create a more responsive, 
user-friendly lighting control system that meets the demands of contemporary living spaces.
