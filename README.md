## Title : “Innovative Clap Switch: Integrating IR Detection With Arduino” 
Clap switches have long been a popular and convenient way to control electronic devices, especially in home automation systems. These devices use a simple sound sensor to detect the distinct pattern of a clap, enabling users to control appliances like lights, fans, or televisions without physical interaction. Despite their convenience, traditional clap switches are prone to reliability issues. They can easily be triggered by ambient noise, background sounds, or indistinct claps, leading to false activations. In addition, they lack the ability to adapt to more complex environments or situations that require proximity detection, such as detecting the presence of a person in the room.
